# Kernel Oops Faulty Driver Analysis

A kernel oops was manually invoked by passing a string to the faulty module device `/dev/faulty`. The kernel oops is listed below:

```
# echo "hello_world" > /dev/faulty

This first line, "`Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address`" tells us that the failure was due to driver code trying to derefrence a NULL pointer. For our qumu kernel instance it outputs the program counter or `pc` at the time of the kernel oops which tells us that the instruction it failed on is in the `faulty_write` function defined in the `[faulty]` module:

```
pc : faulty_write+0x14/0x20 [faulty]
```

If we break this down further it is telling us that the NULL pointer dereference happened at the instruction address that is 0x14 or 20 bytes into the `faulty_write` function  and the instruction is 0x20 or 32 bytes long.

If we look at an `objdump` of the faulty driver we can see the assembly instructions for the faulty_write function:

```
Disassembly of section .text:

0000000000000000 <faulty_write>:
   0:	d503245f 	bti	c
   4:	d2800001 	mov	x1, #0x0                   	// #0
   8:	d2800000 	mov	x0, #0x0                   	// #0
   c:	d503233f 	paciasp
  10:	d50323bf 	autiasp
  14:	b900003f 	str	wzr, [x1]
  18:	d65f03c0 	ret
  1c:	d503201f 	nop
```

Here we can see the instruction at 0x14  is:
```
14:	b900003f 	str	wzr, [x1]
```
This instruction is the location where it stores the value located at address `[x1]` into the `wzr` or zero register. If we look at the instruction at address 0x4 we can see that the address of `[x1]` is set to zero or NULL, therefore the instruction at address 0x14 fails trying to access the memory at an invalid and in-accessible address (0x0 or NULL).
